  <h3 id="profile">👤 My Profile</h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eco C. Gayapa</strong>.  
  I am an ICT student at TCU. My name is Eco C. Gayapa, and I would describe myself as someone who enjoys excitement and creativity, My name is Eco C. Gayapa, and one of the things that truly defines me is my love for watching action movies. I enjoy the thrill, excitement, and fast-paced energy that action films bring, especially when the characters face challenges and fight for something bigger than themselves. Action movies make me feel inspired because they often show courage, resilience, and determination, qualities I want to practice in my own life. Out of all the studios that create amazing films, Marvel is my absolute favorite because they bring together superheroes, powerful stories, and unforgettable adventures. Every time I watch a Marvel film, I feel like I am stepping into a world full of hope, bravery, and lessons about teamwork. I love how Marvel heroes are not only strong but also human, with flaws and struggles that make them relatable. Characters like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Captain America inspire me in different ways, whether it is about confidence, responsibility, or standing up for what is right. What I admire most about Marvel is how they connect all their movies into one universe, making each film a piece of a larger story. This creative storytelling keeps me excited and always looking forward to the next adventure.
Being a Marvel fan is more than just enjoying movies, it feels like being part of a community of people who share the same passion. I can talk for hours about Marvel characters, their journeys, and the life lessons their stories teach. For me, watching Marvel movies is not just entertainment, but also motivation to face my own challenges with bravery. I also appreciate how Marvel mixes humor with action, making every film both exciting and enjoyable. The special effects and action scenes always keep me on the edge of my seat, while the emotional moments remind me that even heroes have struggles. This balance makes Marvel my favorite because it feels real even in a fictional world. I often rewatch my favorite Marvel films whenever I need inspiration or just want to relax. Each time, I discover something new about the characters or the story that makes me love them even more. Action movies in general give me energy, but Marvel holds a special place in my heart because it has been part of my growth and imagination for years. Being a fan of Marvel and action films shows my love for excitement, adventure, and stories that remind me of strength and courage.

Technology is another favorite of mine, since it connects me to movies, music, and friends. Social media and online platforms help me express myself and discover new things I never would have known otherwise. My favorite times of day are the evenings, when I can finally rest and enjoy the things I love most without rushing. I also love weekends because they give me time to recharge and focus on hobbies. Being around supportive friends and family is another favorite part of my life, because they give me strength and happiness.
